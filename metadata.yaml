description: High school senior Ken Ward is on top of the world--he's popular, a somebody.
  But as a freshman at Wayne University, Ken quickly discovers he's a nobody who's
  treated like dirt by upperclassmen. When Ken can't stand the harassment anymore,
  he bursts out of his gloom by slugging a sophomore bully--who turns out to be captain
  of the varsity baseball team. It looks as if Ken's dream of making that team has
  gone down the drain ... until in a moment of wild excitement he proves himself with,
  of all things, a potato! And Ken keeps on proving himself until the last out of
  a heart-pounding.
